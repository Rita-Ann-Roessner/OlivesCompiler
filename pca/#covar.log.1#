Program: covar
Working directory: /mnt/DATA20To/rita/OlivesCompiler/pca

Read 1000 frames from pca.xtc (time 0 to 499 ps)
Read reference structure for fit from pca.pdb

Analysis group is 'System' (186 atoms)
Fit group is 'System' (186 atoms)
Analysis is non-mass weighted
Fit is non-mass weighted
Diagonalized the 558x558 covariance matrix
Trace of the covariance matrix before diagonalizing: 4.9344
Trace of the covariance matrix after diagonalizing: 4.9344

Wrote 558 eigenvalues to eigenval.xvg
Wrote reference structure to eigenvec.trr
Wrote average structure to average.pdb and eigenvec.trr
Wrote eigenvectors 1 to 558 to eigenvec.trr
